This marked his second consecutive national indoor gold at U18. (In this championship he also
earned a bronze in the 400m, as a tight finish decided the top three in that race .)
According to Serbian media, Mojsa amassed a total of five national 800m titles across youth categories .
The above four victories are documented; an additional title (likely at the U20 level) contributes to his total of
five. Each  of  these  national  wins  cemented  Mojsa’s  status  as  one  of  Serbia’s  top  middle-distance
prospects of his generation.
Notable International Competitions
Even as a junior , Mojsa gained experience on the international stage. His most significant international
appearance was at the 2019 Balkan U18 Championships  in Istanbul, Turkey. Selected by national coach
Edin Zuković due to his strong season results , Mojsa donned the national team vest in the 800m.
Despite being the youngest in the field (the only competitor born in 2003), he exceeded expectations –
entering with only the 10th-fastest seed time, he fought through to finish 4th place in the 800m final
. This fourth-place finish at the Balkan meet is regarded as a major success in his youth career . 
Mojsa was also invited to other international junior events – for example, he received a call-up for a six-
nation indoor match in Istanbul (“Šestomeč”) – though he had to decline that opportunity due to health
issues . In addition, he has been a regular member of Serbia’s national junior training camps since
2018 , reflecting his standing as a promising athlete in the country.
Since 2023, Mojsa has been competing in the United States collegiate circuit, which, while not an
international championship for Serbia, has given him exposure to high-level competition abroad. He
has raced in NCAA Division I meets, including cross-country regionals and track invitationals ,
further broadening his competitive experience.
Club Affiliations, Coaching, and Training
Club History:  Mojsa hails from Opovo, Serbia, and began his athletics career with the local club  AK
Spartak Opovo . Under Spartak’s guidance, he achieved most of his junior successes. In the 2021–
2022 period, he transferred to the Belgrade-based AK Crvena Zvezda (Red Star) , one of Serbia’s top
track clubs, to train and compete at a higher level . Mojsa credited his time at Crvena Zvezda
with helping him develop further as a runner . However , at the end of 2022 he decided to return to
his home club Spartak Opovo. “I am very happy to be back in Spartak,” Mojsa said upon his return,
emphasizing that Spartak was the best environment for his career and that he would again be training
under his long-time coach in Opovo .
Coaching:  Throughout his youth career ,  Nemanja Stojanović  was Mojsa’s coach and mentor at AK
Spartak. Coach Stojanović was instrumental in Mojsa’s development and guided him to his national
titles and personal bests . Mojsa has noted that under Stojanović’s expert training he achieved
the best results of his career , and he expressed confidence that together they could reclaim his top form
. This coach-athlete partnership has been a cornerstone of Mojsa’s training background. While
competing in the U.S. collegiate system, Mojsa also works with the coaching staff at Chicago State
University, balancing his training between NCAA requirements and his long-term development shaped
by Stojanović’s influence.
Overall, Boris Mojsa’s career trajectory showcases a talented middle-distance runner who excelled in
Serbia’s junior ranks – with numerous national titles and a strong Balkan showing – and who continues
to  pursue  higher  competitive  goals  through  collegiate  athletics  and  beyond.  His  club  loyalty  and12
